=========

This is some code I've put together to show what I've been working on!

You'll find a basic webpage created with HTML, which is linked to .CSS and .JS files to add some formatting and action.

*If you'd like to see how it all looks put together, you can check the link [here](https://rawgithub.com/jwinskill/Git_Going/master/firstProj.html)*
